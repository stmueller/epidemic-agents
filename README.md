Agent-based Epidemic simulation models in R
======

This repository includes a lightweight agent-based epidemic simulation model implemented in R. It was developed to explore cognitive and psychological impacts of various policy decisions.  This git repository includes R markdown files producing simulation output, plus markdown-generated web pages showing the results of the simulation.

This repository is made available for educational purposes. Users are cautioned that it should not be used for forecasting health care needs during this epidemic.
